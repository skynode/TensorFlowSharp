  summary: Signature of the method that is invoked to release the data.
  remarks: >-
    Methods of this signature are invoked with the data pointer and the
                lenght pointer when then TFBuffer no longer needs to hold on to the
                data.

    content: public delegate void TFBuffer.BufferReleaseFunc(IntPtr data, IntPtr lenght);
